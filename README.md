This application makes an API call to Giphy based on the button clicked.
And then it will display random giphy images on the page that are static.
Clicking on the images, will play them. Clicking again will stop them.
You can add any new search text using the form input and clicking on the Add button.
You can clear all displayed giphy images by clicking on the Clear All button.
Use the Overwrite flag to either overwrite or append to the existing giphy images (Default is overwrite).
